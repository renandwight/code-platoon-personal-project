            <strong>Aurora</strong> is a stock portfolio analysis and research platform built for long-term
            investors who want to make more informed, data-driven decisions.
        </p>

        <p>
            At its core, Aurora allows users to <strong>backtest individual stocks and portfolios
            against historical market data</strong>, helping them understand how an investment would have
            performed over time. Users can evaluate performance using key metrics such as growth, risk,
            and comparative benchmarks, enabling more thoughtful portfolio planning.
        </p>

        <p>
            Aurora also features <strong>custom watchlists</strong>, allowing users to track their favorite
            stocks in one place. Watchlists make it easy to monitor performance trends, compare historical
            results, and quickly revisit assets of interest without re-running searches or analyses.
        </p>

        <p>
            To support timely decision-making, Aurora integrates <strong>up-to-date financial news</strong>,
            giving users access to the latest market headlines directly within the platform. This combines
            quantitative analysis with real-world context, helping users stay informed about events that may
            impact their investments.

            Aurora is being developed as a full-stack application with a focus on clarity, performance,
            and usability—bridging historical data analysis, market monitoring, and financial news into a
